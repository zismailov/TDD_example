# Example how use TDD principles
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: Requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the software is improved to pass the new tests, only.

### Before explaining best practices, it is important to understand the TDD life-cycle.

* Write the test
* Run the test (there is no implementation code, test does not pass)
* Write just enough implementation code to make the test pass
* Run all tests (tests pass)
* Refactor
* Repeat
